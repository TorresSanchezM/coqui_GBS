# Linking pathogen-microbiome-host interactions to explain amphibian population dynamics

### Abstract of the research article

Symbiotic interactions can determine the evolutionary trajectories of host species, influencing genetic variation through selection and changes in demography. In the context of strong selective pressures such as those imposed by infectious diseases, symbionts providing defenses could contribute to increase host fitness upon pathogen emergence. Here, we generated genome-wide data of an amphibian species to find evidence of evolutionary pressures driven by two skin symbionts: a batrachochytrid fungal pathogen and an antifungal bacterium. Using demographic modeling, we found evidence of decreased effective population size likely due to pathogen infections. Additionally, we investigated host genetic associations with infection status, antifungal bacterium abundance, and overall microbiome diversity using structural equation models. We uncovered relatively lower nucleotide diversity in infected frogs and potential heterozygote advantage to recruit the candidate beneficial symbiont and fight infections. Our models indicate that environmental conditions have indirect effects in symbiont abundance through both host body traits and microbiome diversity. Likewise, we uncovered a potential offsetting effect among host heterozygosity-fitness correlations, plausibly pointing to different ecological and evolutionary processes among the three species due to dynamic interactions. Our findings revealed that evolutionary pressures not only arise from the pathogen but also from the candidate beneficial symbiont, and both interactions shape the genetics of the host. Our results advance the knowledge about multipartite symbiotic relationships providing a framework to model ecological and evolutionary dynamics in wild populations. Finally, our study approach can be applied to inform conservation actions such as bioaugmentation strategies for other imperiled amphibians affected by infectious diseases.
